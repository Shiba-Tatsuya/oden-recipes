        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Start with making the pav bhaji masala. To do this, set a pan on medium low and heat until moderately hot. Then lower the heat and add coriander seeds and jeera seeds, roasting them on a low flame for 1-2 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li><P> Add the remaining whole spices and roast on a low flame until fragrant. Then add kasuri methi and briefly roast for a few seconds.</P></li>
            <li><P>Transfer the roasted spices to a plate and allow them to cool down to room temperature. Then transfer the mixture to a grinding jar, add the powdered spices, and grind to form a fine powder.</P></li>
            <li><P>Store this mixture in an airtight container and set it aside in the fridge until needed.</P></li>
            <li><P> For the red chilli paste, transfer the soaked Kashmiri red chillies to a mixer grinder, add water as required and grind to form a fine, runny paste.</P></li>
            <li><P> For the garlic paste, transfer garlic cloves to a mixer grinder, add water as required, and grind to form a fine, runny paste with a watery consistency.</P></li>
            <li><P>To boil the vegetables just right, set the water to boil in a stock pot, add the vegetables, turmeric powder and salt. Cover with a lid and boil until the vegetables turn soft and are cooked through. Strain the water and put them aside for later.</P></li>
            <li><P> Set a big size pan on medium high heat and add butter and oil. Then add jeera and allow the seeds to crackle.</P></li>
            <li><P>Now add onions and cook until they turn pale pink. Add capsicums, turn the heat up to high, and cook for 2-3 minutes.</P></li>
            <li><P>Add the boiled and chopped vegetables, salt, prepared pav bhaji masala, powdered spices and green chilli paste. Combine these ingredients well and try to break down or mash the vegetable chunks with your spatula.</P></li>
            <li><P>To this mixture, add in the prepared garlic and chilli paste and combine well. At first, you could add 1-2 cups of hot water and then use a masher to start mashing the bhaji really well. Keep the flame on low at this point.

            </P></li>
            <li><P>Adjust the consistency of the bhaji by adding additional hot water. Chef recommends thinning it out as street vendors do. This whole process should take about 15-20 minutes.</P></li>
            <li><P>Let the prepared bhaji simmer on a low flame and switch to making the tadka that you can add to the mixture.</P></li>
            <li><P>Set a pan on medium heat, add butter, jeera, prepared red chilli paste and garlic paste, and pav bhaji masala and garam masala. Cook this on a medium-high flame for 1-2 minutes.</P></li>
            <li><P>Add the tadka into the bhaji and mix well. Taste the mixture and adjust the seasoning to taste.</P></li>
            <li><P>Add in freshly chopped coriander leaves, butter, and lemon juice. Combine well and cook on medium heat for 2-3 minutes.</P></li>
            <li><P>You bhaji is now ready!</P></li>
            <li><P>Make the red chilli garlic chutney by adding oil and all the listed ingredients in order to a pan on medium heat. Sir and cook until the oil separate from the chutney. Serve this as a condiment with your pav bhaji!</P></li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Assemble your delicious meal with some butter and red chilli garlic chutney</strong></p>
        <p>Grab pav and slit one into two equal halves, keeping the ends intact. Place a pan on medium heat and add butter, red garlic chutney, and fresh coriander to it.</p>
        <p>Place the pav on the Tawa and coat it with the butter completely. If you’d prefer, toast the bread until it’s golden brown in colour.</p>
        <p>Serve them alongside your bhaji and red chilli garlic chutney as well as a quick medley of cucumber, chopped onions, and lemon. Don’t forget a massive dollop of butter on top!</p>
