        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>How to pressure cook Dal:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse, twice or thrice, a cup of toor or arhar dal under running water until water runs clear.
                At this stage, you can soak the dal for half an hour. But, I skip soaking and cook directly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the rinsed and/or soaked dal into the pressure cooker with 2.5 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Add ¼ tsp of haldi & a tsp of oil in the cooker.</li>
            <li>Now, take a small steel bowl or katori, and add 2 tbsp of peanuts and place the katori in the cooker.
                Dal & peanuts both will be boiled and cooked simultaneously. Using katori helps to separate peanuts easily.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook the dal for 3 to 4 whistles or until the dal is softened.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, let the pressure settle down naturally and keep aside the boiled peanuts. With the help of the whisk, mash the cooked dal to smooth consistency.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to make dhokli dough and cutting in dhokli in shape:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add wheat flour, besan, haldi, red chilli powder, salt and oil.
            </li>
            <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together and crumble with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to knead a soft & smooth dough. Cover & let it sit for 15 to 20 mins. Till then start tempering the cooked dal.</li>
            <li>After 20 mins, divide the dough into 3 equal portions.
            </li>
            <li>With the help of a rolling pin, roll 1 dough portion in a large & thin chapati (flatbread).</li>
            <li>Now, cut the rolled dough into diamond shape or any shape of your choice.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to prepare tempering (tadka) for dal:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a thick wide bottom kadhai or pan, heat 2 tbsp oil and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dry curry leaves, hing & dry red chillies.</li>
            <li>Saute on medium flame, until mustard and cumin seeds crackle.</li>
            <li>Then, add finely chopped ginger, garlic and tomatoes. And saute on medium flame until tomatoes turn soft & mushy.</li>
            <li>When tomatoes are cooked, add red chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder and salt. Saute all the dry spices with the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>When the masala is cooked well with tomatoes, oil releases from the sides, then add in cooked and mashed toor dal.
            </li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients nicely until everything is combined well.</li>
            <li>Then add 2 - 3 cups of water along with the boiled peanuts, jaggery and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients well and cover & cook on medium flame, so that the flavours and aroma from masala combine with dal.</li>
            <li>Once the dal starts boiling, gently slide the diamond-shaped dhokli's in the dal. Give it a nice & gentle mix. Make sure not to mash the dhokli.</li>
            <li>Cook on low-medium flame for 10 -12 minutes or until the dhokli is cooked well.</li>
            <li>Lastly, add chopped fresh coriander leaves and give it a nice mix. At this stage, taste dal dhokli and adjust the spices as per your liking.</li>
            <li>Finally, serve delicious dal dhokli with onion salad on the sides.</li>
        </ol>
